# AVL-Tree C++ Implementation
This is a project to implement AVL-Tree in C++ using Graphviz to visualize the tree as an image.

## Requirments
| Tool | Link |
| ------ | ------ |
| GCC Compiler |
| Graphviz | https://www.graphviz.org/ |

## How to Run it
```sh
$ cd AVL-Tree-CPP-Graphviz
$ make all                          Compile, Graphviz is required
$ make run
$ make PNG                          Creates PNGs of trees in png directory  (optional)
$ make clean                        Reset directory
```
## Notes
    $ make run
Runs 10 test cases , the output after every action is located in "out" directory
